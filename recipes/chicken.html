	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are inexpensive, versatile, and really hard to overcook. If you've picked up a package of boneless chicken thighs at the supermarket, here are 51 different ways to prepare them for easy weeknight dinners.</p>
	<p>Here, you'll find recipes for the slow cooker, air fryer, oven, grill, stovetop, and more, because chicken thighs take well to virtually any cooking method (yet another reason to love them).</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
		<li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
		<li>1/2 cup water</li>
		<li>1/2 red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Place chipotle chile pepper and ancho chile pepper in a bowl; pour in water. Cover bowl and let sit until peppers are softened, at least 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.</li>
		<li>Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.</li>
